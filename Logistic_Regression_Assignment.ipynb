It estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a particular category by applying a logistic function to a linear combination of the input features.

        "    * 90% majority class, 10% minority class\n",
        "    * If the model always predicts the majority class, accuracy = 90%, but it completely fails to predict the minority class.\n",
